The dataset in BlackFriday.csv file (in a zip file at the bottom of this page) is a sample of the transactions made in a retail store. The store wants to know better the customer purchase behaviour against different products. 
Different learning problems can be settled with this dataset. Some problem examples are:

    finding different clusters of consumers within it
    predicting the amount of purchase 
    predicting the category of goods bought 
    predicting the age of the consumer
    recommending a product to a consumer or a category of consumers

Focus on (at least) one specific problem and present a thorough and solid analysis (visualization tools are welcome both in exploration and communication of your results and reflections).
